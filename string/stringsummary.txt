Longest repeated substring - 1:42:16
 - MISSISSIPPI
 - Longest repeated substr - ISSI
 

String problems summary
1) Sliding window - expand and optimize
2) Trie - prefix search, Suffix trie
    - prefix search, palindrome pairs (check in forward and reverse trie), longest repeated substring
3) Longest Palindrome - from each pos, expand in both directions so long as they match. Do for both odd and even
    - O(n) - manacher algo
	- Suffix trie, compact trie / radix tree
4) Regex matching - recursion

Suffix Tree
- Longest Repeated Substring
- Longest common substring
- most repeated substring
- Hash of a string is O(n) - as we have to go through all characters to generate hashcode
  - tree algorithm dfs with backtracking - longest repeated suffix
